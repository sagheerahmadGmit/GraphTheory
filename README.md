# GraphTheory

Intro
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A program using the Python programming language that can build a NFA from a regular expression. This Project is for Graph Theory and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text.

Context
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-The following project has a real world problem that we may be asked to solve in our workplace or
industry. We are not required to solve this problem from the top of our heads but we should be able toresearch and investigate the different methods that we could apply to the problem to solve it. There are many solutions already available and this is one of them.

Research
