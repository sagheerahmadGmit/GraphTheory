# GraphTheory

Intro
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A program using the Python programming language that can build a NFA from a regular expression. This Project is for Graph Theory and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of tex. This program is a programming excersise for the module 'Graph Theory' in 3rd year Software Development Course. It is written in the Python programming language.

The aim of the project is to write an application that will match the regular expression to Ken Thompsons' construction. It will do this by taking an NFA infix and converting it to a postfix expression using the shunting algorithm. It will then match it with a given string to see if they match.

Context
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-The following project has a real world problem that we may be asked to solve in our workplace or
industry. We are not required to solve this problem from the top of our heads but we should be able toresearch and investigate the different methods that we could apply to the problem to solve it. There are many solutions already available and this is one of them.
